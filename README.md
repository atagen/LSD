Lossy Sound Destroyer

a quick python GUI for an automated FFmpeg process, aimed at people interested in (ab)using lossy compression to create interesting artifacts.

prerequisites:
+ local FFmpeg installation
+ python 3.7
+ Gooey

you may either run the `LSD.py` directly from python, or use the `setup.py` with PyInstaller to create an executable.

alternatively, use the 'releases' tab on the right to download a precompiled binary.
you will still need a local FFmpeg for this.
